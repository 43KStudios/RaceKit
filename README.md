# RaceKit
Racing component system using 100% blueprints for Unreal Engine 4

Race Kit is a easy solution for implementing racing as a starting point for a racing game or as a new feature to your existing action or open world game.  Works with any player type whether it's an already existing character or vehicle, on land, in the sea, or in the air! Simply add the Race Kit Component to your racer of choice, drag in Race Kit Checkpoints around your racing area, and drag in a Race Kit Manager.
